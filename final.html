      Thank you so much for clicking yes on the first try, I just wanted to let you know how grateful i am that i have you in my life, i wish i was there with you right now but i hope that this makes you smile at the very least, I love you so much Aysha you mean the world to me I'm so lucky that i have you in my life, I'm thankful for everything that you've done for me , everything changed the moment you entered my life and in the best possible way I love you more than you can imagine and I'm sorry that i don't show it at times, I genuinely don't know how to show you the amount of love i have for you as i myself can't get a grasp of how much i love you, you make me the happiest guy on the planet, no matter what I'm going through, you always let me know that you're by my side and that gives me comfort and calms me down, Im sorry if all of this seems corny I've never tried anything like this , this is me going out of my comfort zone, I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you and i can't wait to get you everything that you want but will never ask for , I'm so grateful that we crossed paths because i don't know how my life would've turned if i hadn't met you but i can say it with a strong heart that it would never be as amazing as it is now, you don't deserve to be showered with love on one day rather you deserve to be praised throughout the year, baby i love you so much and i can't wait to spend decades with you and buying you gummies (eventhough it's bad for your teeth🤓) and watch romcom movies and genuinely just grow old with you, i love you so much , more than anything, Thank you for loving me ❤️
